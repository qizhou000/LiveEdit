I had written a song with Avicii that week in Sweden called \u201cStay with You\u201d and he was playing in Ibiza so I said, \u2018I will just go there with you,\u2019 because I was already in Europe. I don\u2019t have like a regular 9\u20135 job \u2026 so might as well go to Ibiza, right? I had never been there before. So I went. We were at his show and I was drinking at the time. I just sort of moseyed out into the audience to watch Avicii spin from their point of view. I would go back and forth between the backstage and the VIP area and then where the actual kids were. And most people didn't know who the fuck I was in Ibiza except for this one guy who recognized me. He was like, 'Are you Mike Posner?' and he was all excited. He holds up this little bag of pills and is like, 'You want one?' And drunk Mike Posner was like, 'Fuck it, yeah.' So I took one and I had never done that before, and then I felt amazing. Then when I came down I felt 10 years older.",
